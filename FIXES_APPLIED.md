# LocaNoche Payment System Fixes - Session Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Vercel Environment Variables
**Problem**: N8N webhook URLs were outdated or missing
**Solution**:
- Removed old environment variables
- Added correct N8N webhook URLs:
  - `N8N_EVENT1_WEBHOOK_URL=https://tasos8.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/loca-noche-event1-payment`
  - `N8N_EVENT2_WEBHOOK_URL=https://tasos8.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/loca-noche-event2-payment`
  - `N8N_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://tasos8.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/loca-noche-payment-success`

### 2. ✅ N8N Workflow - Customer Data Handling
**Problem**: N8N workflows weren't receiving customer data
**Solution**:
- Updated `lib/payment/n8n-payment.ts` to include `customerData` in webhook payload
- Updated `app/api/payments/n8n/route.ts` to pass `customerData` to N8N service
- Updated N8N workflow "Prepare Payment Data" node to properly extract customer info from nested `body.customerData`

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/payment/n8n-payment.ts` (line 123)
- `app/api/payments/n8n/route.ts` (line 40)

### 3. ✅ Frontend - preCalculated Flag
**Problem**: Frontend wasn't sending `preCalculated: true` flag
**Solution**: Added `preCalculated: true` to payment request in `app/tickets/page.tsx` (line 154)

### 4. ✅ N8N Workflow - IF Node Condition
**Problem**: IF node was checking `$json.preCalculated` instead of `$json.body.preCalculated`
**Solution**: Updated both Event 1 and Event 2 workflows' IF node conditions

### 5. ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE: N8N Response Formatting
**Problem**: N8N "Return Payment URL" node is not properly formatting the webhook response. It's returning:
```json
{"orderCode": 3770486857263998}
```

Instead of:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentUrl": "https://www.vivapayments.com/web/checkout?ref=3770486857263998",
  "orderCode": 3770486857263998,
  "amount": 10,
  "quantity": 1,
  "event": "Oktoberfest - Minus One",
  "eventId": "1",
  "description": "...",
  "paymentCode": "1309"
}
```

**What We Tried**:
1. Using template strings with `{{ }}` syntax - didn't work
2. Using JavaScript expression with `={{ }}` syntax - didn't work
3. Attempted to add a Code node before the response - failed due to connection issues

**Root Cause**: The "Respond to Webhook" node in N8N is not evaluating expressions that reference other nodes (like `$node["Prepare Payment Data"].json.totalAmount`). It only passes through the current `$json` object.

## Recommended Solution

### Option A: Fix N8N Workflow (Recommended)
Add a Code node between "Create VivaPayments Order" and "Return Payment URL" to format the response:

```javascript
const vivaOrder = $input.first().json;
const preparedData = $('Prepare Payment Data').first().json;

return [{
  json: {
    success: true,
    paymentUrl: `https://www.vivapayments.com/web/checkout?ref=${vivaOrder.orderCode}`,
    orderCode: vivaOrder.orderCode,
    amount: preparedData.totalAmount,
    quantity: preparedData.totalQuantity,
    event: preparedData.eventName,
    eventId: preparedData.eventId,
    description: preparedData.description,
    paymentCode: preparedData.paymentCode
  }
}];
```

Then update "Return Payment URL" node to simply use `={{ $json }}`

### Option B: Fix in API Layer (Quick Workaround)
Modify `lib/payment/n8n-payment.ts` to construct the response from the N8N orderCode:

```typescript
const result = await response.json();

// If N8N only returned orderCode, construct full response
if (result.orderCode && !result.success) {
  return {
    success: true,
    paymentUrl: `https://www.vivapayments.com/web/checkout?ref=${result.orderCode}`,
    orderCode: result.orderCode,
    amount: paymentRequest.totalAmount,
    quantity: paymentRequest.totalQuantity,
    // ... etc
  };
}
```

## Current System Status

✅ **Working**:
- N8N webhooks are receiving requests
- Customer data is being extracted properly
- VivaPayments orders are being created successfully
- Payment codes and descriptions are correct

⚠️ **Not Working**:
- API returns `{"error":"Payment creation failed: Unknown error"}` because N8N response is missing `success: true` field

## Next Steps

1. Open N8N workflow in browser UI
2. Add a Code node named "Format Response" after "Create VivaPayments Order"
3. Use the JavaScript code from Option A above
4. Connect: Create VivaPayments Order → Format Response → Return Payment URL
5. Update Return Payment URL to use `={{ $json }}`
6. Test the payment flow

OR

Implement Option B as a temporary workaround until N8N workflow can be manually fixed.
