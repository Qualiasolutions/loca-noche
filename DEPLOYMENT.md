# LocaNoche Payment & Ticketing System - Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Complete Payment Flow Overview

The system implements a fully automated ticketing system with the following flow:

1. **Customer selects tickets** on `/tickets` page
2. **Fills customer information** using CustomerForm component
3. **Payment is created** via N8N workflow that calls VivaPayments API
4. **Customer is redirected** to VivaPayments checkout
5. **After successful payment**, customer returns to `/success` page
6. **Webhook processes payment** and generates tickets with QR codes
7. **Email is sent** to customer with tickets
8. **Database is updated** with booking and ticket records

## üß™ Testing the Complete Flow

### Test Payment Flow:

1. Go to `https://locanoche.com/tickets`
2. Select tickets for Event 1 or Event 2
3. Click "Continue" and fill customer information

6. After payment, check:
   - Success page shows confirmation
   - Email is received with QR code tickets
   - Database has booking record

### Verify Webhook Processing:

Check N8N execution logs:
1. Go to N8N ‚Üí Workflows
2. Click on workflow ‚Üí Executions
3. Check for successful executions

### Database Verification:

```sql
-- Check bookings
SELECT * FROM "Booking" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check tickets
SELECT * FROM "Ticket" WHERE "bookingId" = '[booking-id]';
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Payment creation fails**
   - Check N8N webhook URL is correct
   - Verify VivaPayments credentials
   - Check N8N workflow is active

2. **No redirect after payment**
   - Verify success/failure URLs in VivaPayments
   - Check URL parameters are being passed

3. **Tickets not received**
   - Check email credentials
   - Verify N8N email node configuration
   - Check spam folder

4. **QR codes not generating**
   - Ensure QRCode package is installed
   - Check N8N workflow execution logs

## üìä Monitoring
