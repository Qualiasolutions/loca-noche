## 🐛 **Bugs Fixed Today:**

### 1. ✅ Wrong Event Detection
**Before:** Event 2 customers got Event 1 tickets  
**Fix:** Now uses Viva `SourceCode` field (most reliable)  
**Result:** Event 2 (5711) → Sunday tickets, Event 1 (1309) → Saturday tickets

### 2. ✅ Wrong Quantity
**Before:** Paid for 3, got 1 (or paid for 1, got 5)  
**Fix:** Extracts from CustomerTrns "3x adult" format  
**Result:** Get exactly what you pay for

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Tickets
**Before:** Could generate same ticket ID twice  
**Fix:** Uses OrderCode + timestamp + 9 random chars  
**Result:** 100% unique tickets every time

### 4. ✅ Wrong Year
**Before:** Showed 2024  
**Fix:** Updated to 2025  
**Result:** Correct year everywhere

### 5. ✅ Confusing UI
**Before:** "300 tickets available" shown  
**Fix:** Removed that display  
**Result:** Cleaner interface

### 6. ✅ Wrong Admin Email Event
**Before:** Event 2 sale showed "Minus One" in admin email  
**Fix:** Uses correct event from SourceCode  
**Result:** Admin emails show correct event name

## ⚠️ **Console Errors You Can IGNORE:**

These appear on Viva's checkout page (NOT your site):

```
❌ globalize.culture.en.js:1 404 - Viva's missing file
❌ Google Maps API loaded without async - Viva's performance warning
❌ Could not find cvv/year/month inputs - Viva's optional fields
❌ Installments errors - Feature not enabled on your account
```

**These are HARMLESS:**
- They're from Viva Payments' own checkout page
- They don't affect payment processing
- They don't affect ticket generation
- Payments complete successfully despite these warnings
